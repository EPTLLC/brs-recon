- **Never exceed authorized boundaries** even if technically possible
- **Document all testing activities** for transparency

### 2. DO NO HARM

- **Minimize impact** on target systems and users
- **Avoid disrupting normal operations** of tested systems
- **Do not access, modify, or delete** unauthorized data
- **Respect privacy** and confidentiality of discovered information

### 3. RESPONSIBLE DISCLOSURE

- **Report vulnerabilities responsibly** to system owners
- **Allow reasonable time** for remediation before public disclosure
- **Follow coordinated disclosure timelines** (typically 90 days)
- **Provide constructive remediation guidance** when possible

### 4. PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT

- **Maintain confidentiality** of client information and findings
- **Use findings solely for security improvement** purposes
- **Avoid sensationalism** in vulnerability reporting
- **Respect intellectual property** rights

## TESTING BEST PRACTICES

   - Avoid resource-intensive operations during business hours
   - Monitor system performance impact
   - Stop testing if issues arise

2. **Documentation**
   - Log all testing activities
   - Screenshot evidence of findings
   - Record timestamps and methodologies
   - Maintain chain of custody for evidence

### Post-Testing Responsibilities

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Secure all testing data and evidence
   - Remove any test artifacts from target systems
   - Notify stakeholders of completion
   - Begin vulnerability analysis

2. **Reporting**
   - Provide clear, actionable vulnerability reports
   - Include risk assessments and remediation guidance

## Development History

### Design Philosophy

BRS-RECON was developed as a complete Python reimplementation of the original Bash-based Brabus Recon Suite (BRS), incorporating lessons learned from the BRS-XSS project architecture.

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Modular Architecture:** Each scanning discipline implemented as independent module
2. **Performance First:** Optimized algorithms and parallel execution throughout  
3. **Professional Quality:** Enterprise-grade error handling and reporting
4. **Standards Compliance:** SARIF output for security tool ecosystem integration
5. **Maintainable Code:** Strict file size limits and clean separation of concerns

## Future Roadmap

### Planned Features (Future Versions)

- **Interactive TUI interface** matching original BRS menu system
- **Attack tools module** for authorized penetration testing
- **Configuration management** with YAML/TOML support
- **Result aggregation** and trend analysis
- **Docker containerization** for consistent deployment
- **CI/CD integration** templates and examples

### Performance Targets

- **Network discovery:** <1 second for /24 networks
- **Port scanning:** <30 seconds for top 1000 ports  
- **Domain reconnaissance:** <5 seconds basic, <60 seconds comprehensive
- **Vulnerability assessment:** <2 minutes basic scan
- **System information:** <1 second complete profile
